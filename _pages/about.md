Hello, I'm a 4th-year computer engineering student. I mostly work with Java and .Net. I also enjoy fighting with Python :D. In addition to these, I do readings and research about software development processes and principles. My general purpose in the blog is to research and reinforce the topics I have learned and to share them with other people.
